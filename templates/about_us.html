        This project aims to provide an interface for an e-library (i.e. a Library Management System). This application can be used by both users and librarians. 
        Users can request, read and buy books (PDF files) with some restrictions as specified by the guideline document (The user can  request utmost 5 books at 
        a time and also a user can access a book maximum for 15 days after which access to the book will be revoked). The user also has a cart functionality through 
        which he can buy many books in a single click. On the other a librarian has more authority such as updating/adding books, sections, authors and accessing some 
        statistics about the application. Both users and librarian have separate login systems where a user can sign up too, RBAC is used to differentiate between user 
        and librarian. This app is developed keeping in mind factors such as ease of access, minimalistic styling and minimal complexities (like adding buttons and links 
        only when required, easy search etc.). For the storage purpose sqlite3 has been used but for storage of book content a different approach has been used wherein the 
        pdf files are directly stored in the server and only the filename is stored in the database, this allows ease of displaying book content and downloading the book as 
        pdf too. Various models are used in order to store different information about different components of the app. As part of the project a REST APIâ€™s are developed for 
        the Books, Sections, Authors and Graphs to get, update, add or delete book, section or author. The graph API has only a GET method allowed so graphs can be fetched using it.
